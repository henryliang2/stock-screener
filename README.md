## Description

Stock screeners are largely ill-suited for use by non-professional investors. Screeners generally return results that provide an immense amount of quantitative data. While reviewing stocks strictly by technical or fundamental measures can be useful for institutional investors, most retail investors instead seek out companies to invest in based on stories, branding, and belief in their products. Stock screener outputs provide little if any insight into these non-quantative traits. This limits the utility of the screener, as many retail investors do not assess technical or fundamental measures of the stocks they invest in at all.

I envisioned a stock screener output that would allow a user to browse stocks by their non-quantitative information and branding. Stock surfer was the result.
