## Description

Stock screeners generally return results that provide an immense amount of quantitative data. While reviewing stocks strictly by technical or fundamental measures can be useful for institutional investors, most retail investors instead seek out companies to invest in based on stories, branding, and belief in their products. 
Because of this, stock screeners are largely ill-suited for use by non-professional investors, because their outputs provide little if any insight into these non-quantative qualities that retail investors look for. Many retail investors do not assess technical or fundamental measures of the stocks they invest in at all.

I envisioned a stock screener output that would allow a user to browse stocks by their non-quantitative information and branding. StockSurfer was the result.
