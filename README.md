## Description

Stock screeners generally return an immense amount of quantitative data that can be difficult to decipher for retail investors. While reviewing stocks strictly by technical or fundamental measures can be useful for institutional investors, most retail investors instead seek out companies to invest in based on stories, branding, and belief in their products. Because of this, stock screeners are largely ill-suited for use by non-professional investors; their outputs provide little if any insight into the subjective qualities that retail investors look for. Many retail investors do not assess technical or fundamental measures of the stocks they invest in at all.

I envisioned a stock screener output that would allow a user to browse stocks by their non-quantitative information and branding. StockSurfer was the result.
